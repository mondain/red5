This directory contains SWC compilations of the AsUnit GPL
source code.

See http://asunit.org/

It contains no changes beyond the following:
- Any classes that have no package (e.g. AsUnitTestRunner.as) are
  not included in the SWC

The Library naming convention is:

  asunit-as3-MAJOR-MINOR-REVISION

Since AsUnit doesn't really release, we're calling this MAJOR=1, MINOR=0

Revision always corresponds to the SVN revision number in the asunit
source code (so you always know which revision number to fetch from SVN).

As of this check-in, you can find the AsUnit AS3 framework source here:

  http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/asunit/trunk/framework/as3/

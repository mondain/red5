    When you run jobs that require TCP/IP ports (such as for testing purpose) in a machine
    with multiple executors, multiple jobs that just so happen to run at the same time
    may interfere with each other by using the same TCP/IP port.
  <p>
    You can avoid such a conflict by manually assining unique TCP/IP ports to every job on Hudson,
    but that will quickly get very tedious.

    This feature solves this problem by letting Hudson do the bookkeeping and allocate
    unique port numbers.
  <p>
    To use this feature, list up such TCP ports by giving them names. Before the build starts,
    Hudson will allocate unique ports and pass them as environment variables to the build.
    For example, if you add <tt>ABC_PORT</tt> and <tt>DEF_PORT</tt>, you can access them like
    <tt>echo $ABC_PORT</tt> from your build.
  <p>
    By choosing the right TCP port type, you can make Hudson do the clean up processing.
    This is particularly useful for taking care of run-away daemon processes.
  <p>
    This feature also allows jobs to require a certain fixed port. For example, if your job
    is testing a mail server, where you'd require port 25 and no other ports would do,
    then simply add <tt>25</tt> as the name, so that Hudson can make sure that no two
    jobs that require the same port will run on the same node concurrently.

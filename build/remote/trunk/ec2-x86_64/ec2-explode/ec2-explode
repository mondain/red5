# This scripts takes a brand new "Ubuntu 8.0.4 LTS Hardy" release on
# Amazon.ec2 and preps it to be a build server hosted at
# http://build.theyard.net
#
# To use:
#  Learn how to start up an instance on EC2
#  Start up the following instance: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1427&categoryID=101
#  Copy the contents of the explode directory to your new instance
#    A "somewhat" convient way to do that from this directory is:
#     ex2-implode /tmp/ec2-explode.tgz
#     scp -i YOUR_AWS_IDRSA_FILE /tmp/ec2-explode.tgz root@YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-DNS:/tmp
#     Log into your EC2 instance
#     If necessary, un tar the file you just copied
#       cd /tmp && tar -xzvf /tmp/ec2-explode.tgz
#  Run: /tmp/ec2-explode
#   It's not completely unattended; you'll need to accept Sun's JDK
#   license, and generate a VNC password towards the end
#
#  Edit the following file to correctly identify YOUR site
#   /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/build.theyard.net
#
#  Restart apache2
#   service apache2 restart
#
#  Go to your hudson build; it should have some sensible defaults, but
#  and a hudson user configured.  The default password is "fmskiller"
#  feel free to change it.

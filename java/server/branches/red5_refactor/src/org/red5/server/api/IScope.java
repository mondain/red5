/**
 * The Scope Object.
 * 
 * A statefull object shared between a group of clients connected to the same
 * context path. Scopes are arranged in a hierarchical way, so its possible for
 * a scope to have a parent. If a client is connect to a scope then they are also
 * connected to its parent scope. The scope object is used to access resources,
 * shared object, streams, etc.
 * 
 * The following are all names for scopes: application, room, place, lobby.

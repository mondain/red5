Jira-Trac Migration
===================

This document describes how to use the convert.py script that allows
you to import existing Jira data into a Trac database. This script
requires Python 3.0 or newer.

Getting started
===============

From a commandline prompt run the following:

./convert.py -i backup.xml -o test.txt -q

The '-i' option should point to the relative or absolute path of the
exported backup XML file that was generated by Jira.

The '-o' option should point to the relative or absolute path of the
target Trac database (SQLite) where the converted Jira data will be
imported.

The '-q' option allows you to suppress debug messages.

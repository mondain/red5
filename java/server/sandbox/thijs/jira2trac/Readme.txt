Jira to Trac Migration
======================

This document describes how to use the jira.py script that allows
you to import existing Jira data into a Trac database using XML-RPC.
This script requires Python 3.1 or newer. It was tested with
Atlassian Jira Enterprise 3.6.5 (build 161) and Edgewall Trac
0.11.4. The Trac instance needs to have the XML-RPC 1.0 and
AccountManager plugins installed.

Instructions
============

From a commandline prompt run the following:

./jira.py -i backup.xml -l localhost:8000 -u john -p passw0rd

The '-i' option should point to the relative or absolute path of the
exported backup XML file that was generated by Jira.

The '-a' option should point to the relative or absolute path of the
Jira attachments folder.

The '-l' option should point to the host name of the target Trac
instance where the converted Jira data should be imported.

The '-u' option defines a valid username for the Trac instance.

The '-p' option defines a valid password for the Trac instance.

    AIR Application Descriptor File: 
    Specifies parameters for identifying, installing, and launching AIR applications.

    The root element of the descriptor is "application" and has the attributes:
    appID   - A string identifying this application. Every AIR application must
              have a unique appID. The recommended form of an appID is a 
              dot-delimited, reverse-DNS-style string, such as 
              "com.example.ApplicationName". The appID string must be between 
              17-255 characters long and may include the following characters:
              0-9 
              a-z 
              A-Z 
              . (dot)
              - (hyphen)              
    version - An application-defined version designator.
              Examples: "1.0", ".4", "0.5", "Alpha 1",
    xmlns   - The AIR namespace ("http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/1.0.M4").

        Attributes:
        systemChrome - "standard" or "none". If "standard", the application 
                       window is opened with operating system-specific window 
                       elements such as a title bar, minimize, and close 
                       buttons. If "none", the application must provide its 
                       own window controls. (Note, the Flex WindowedApplication 
                       class supplies a set of window controls, which are only 
                       shown when systemChrome="none".)

                       for full transparency.
        visible      - "true" or "false". If "false", the main window will not 
                       be displayed 
                       until the application changes the window visible property 
                       to "true".
        width        - the initial window height (including chrome).
        height       - the initial window width (including chrome).

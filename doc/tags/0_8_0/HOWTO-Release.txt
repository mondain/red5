Red5 release manual
===================

This document describes the steps necessary to create a new release of Red5:

1. Make sure everything has been committed to the trunk or correct branch.

2. Update the file doc/changelog.txt with informations about the new release.

3. Create tags of the modules that are linked into the main code tree:

   - documentation at https://red5.googlecode.com/svn/doc/tags
   
   Tags for versions should always be the version string with dots replaced
   by underscores, e.g. version "1.2.3" becomes tag "1_2_3".
   
   If you would tag the documentation folder for version "1.2.3", you would
   use the url https://red5.googlecode.com/svn/doc/tags/1_2_3

4. Tag the server code according to the naming scheme from above at
   https://red5.googlecode.com/svn/java/server/tags

5. Update the svn:externals in the newly created server code tag to point
   to the tagged modules from step 3.

6. Tag the flash and java examples code according to the naming scheme from above at
   https://red5.googlecode.com/svn/flash/tags and
   https://red5.googlecode.com/svn/java/examples/tags

7. You're done.

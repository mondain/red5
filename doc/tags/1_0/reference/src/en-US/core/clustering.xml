	<title>Clustering</title>
	<para>In Red5 0.7 the Ant build.xml file contains a build target that creates a 'cluster' folder containing the same setup as described below. Use 'ant dist-cluster' to create the Red5 clustering setup.</para>
	<note>
		<title>Limitations</title>
		<para>As of now, the current trunk only supports the clustering configuration for multiple Edges with one Origin. The Edge server only accepts RTMP connection.</para>

			<title>Configuration Files</title>
			<para>There are several configuration files added to support Edge/Origin configuration.</para>
			<para>red5-edge.xml, red5-edge-core.xml - used for edge spring bean configuration. They are under conf/.</para>
			<para>red5-origin.xml, red5-origin-core.xml - used for origin spring bean configuration. They are under conf/.</para>

		<para>You don't need to deploy your application on Edges.</para>
		<para>We strongly recommend you to deploy Edge on a different server from Origin. But it should be OK to deploy the Edge on the same server as Origin.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>As of version 0.8, the Red5 Testing framework has been modified and updated. The unit-tests have been updated to pass, and a automated system-testing and continuous integration framework has been added.
			This document attempts to explain the thoughts and architecture involved so as to facilitate review by the Red5 core team.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Unit Testing</title>
		<section>
			<title>Purpose</title>
			<para>The purpose of a unit test is to make sure a java object operates according to its specification, regardless of how it is plugged in with other objects. For a good overview of check out this 
				<link xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Wikipedia Unit Testing web page</link>.
				For example, you can (and we do) have Unit Tests that test we're encoding and decoding data from AMF codec's correctly using Mock Objects, that test whether or not we can load information from Spring, and whether or not we can inject Meta Data into FLV viles correctly.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Technology</title>
			<para>Red5 uses the 
				<link xl:href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</link> unit testing framework. If you're not familiar with that suite, please check it out. It is the de-facto standard for Java Unit Testing.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Running Tests</title>
			<para> To run tests, checkout the latest server build, and run the following ant command:</para>
			<screen> 
$ ant run-tests
</screen>
			<para>To see the results, you can open the doc/test/index.html file once the tests are finished.</para>
			<literallayout> 
firefox doc/test/index.html
</literallayout>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Creating New Tests</title>
			<para>Writing unit tests in the 
				<link xl:href="http://junit.org">JUnit</link> framework is beyond the scope of this document, but you can find help at the JUnit site. The Red5 unit test framework support JUnit 4.0, but can run JUnit 3.x-style tests as well.
				To create a new unit test, just create a new JUnitclass source file to the right path under test, and end the source filename with the string "Test.java". For example, to test org.red5.server.api.ANewClass, you would create the following java file under the "test" directory:
			</para>
			<literallayout> 
test/org/red5/server/api/ANewClassTest.java
</literallayout>
			<para>Once you do that, the compile process should pick up your new file and run the tests automatically.&amp;nbsp;</para>
			<para>By default, the run-tests runs all unit tests in the following directory:</para>
			<literallayout> 
bin/testcases/testreports
</literallayout>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Running unit tests from eclipse</title>
			<para>In theory every should work, but you may need to set the directory eclipse runs the test from.  Make sure it is set to:</para>
			<literallayout> 
bin/testcases/testreports
</literallayout>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Guidelines for New Unit Tests</title>
			<para>Unit tests help make the code base stronger, but that said we do need to make sure that unit tests meet certain guidelines so we can have a useful build process. Those guidelines are:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests MUST be self-contained (i.e. each test should run independently).</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests MUST not require a Red5 server to be running.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests MAY assume that no Red5 instance is currently running while they run (and so may fire up Red5 objects that bind to ports if appropriate).</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests MUST NOT require thread-timing specific to your machine to run (or fail) consistently.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests MUST run successfully 100% in order to be checked in. That means, no checking in tests that fail with "not implemented".</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests SHOULD try to avoid introducing new dependencies, but if you must use one (for example 
						<link xl:href="http://multithreadedtc.googlecode.com/">http://multithreadedtc.googlecode.com/</link> can be useful), identify it when you submit a JUnit test case and we'll review whether or not to add to the ivy test dependencies.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests MUST document what they do, and how to tell if they really worked, in JavaDoc comments above each test method.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unit Tests SHOULD be written using JUnit 4.x annotations</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Submitting New Unit Tests</title>
			<para>We really want new Unit Tests, so if you have a Unit Test that meets the above guidelines we'd love to consider it. To submit it, do the following:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Review the guidelines above. Really.</para>

			<title>Suggesting New Unit Tests</title>
			<para>We really do want new unit tests, and would love suggestions. But bear in mind that Red5 is a 100% volunteer project and most people who work on it have full time day jobs (their time spent on red5 is a labor of love). So don't be hurt if your suggestion for a test is not picked up on.</para>
			<para>That said, a great way to suggest an area to test is to go ahead and write the system test yourself\! Send it to the list, and it'll probably get a warm reception.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Integration Testing</title>
		<para>We currently don't have a 
			<link xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">integration testing framework</link>, but when I next return to this area, I'll try adding one. The basic idea for this (which I love) is to make a framework based on the RTMPClient.
		</para>
		<section>
			<title>Purpose</title>
			<para>The purpose of integration testing is to start to plug together different simpler modules (that hopefully have been unit tested) to see if they play nice together. See this Integration Testing Wikipedia Pagefor an overview of the concepts.</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>System Testing</title>
		<section>
			<title>Purpose</title>
			<para>When all is set and done, and you've Unit tested everything, and did integration testing by mixing together different components, you're still not done. At some point, a user is going to pick up your application, and start using it. And if you haven't tested from that end to your code and back, well chances are something will break.</para>
			<para>That's where 
				<link xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing">System Testing</link> comes in. In the System Test we try to do some basic end-to-end tests to see if our code performs as expected from the end-user's perspective.
			</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Technology</title>
		<para>For Flash system testing (a.k.a selftest), we use the 
			<link xl:href="http://junit.org/">ASUnit|http://asunit.org/</link> framework, which is very similar to 
			<link xl:href="JUnit">JUnit</link>. You can find the current Flash self test here.
		</para>
		<para>We also use 
			<link xl:href="http://theyard.googlecode.com/">The Yard Flash Libraries</link> to abstract away some components of Flash connecting and stream playing, but you're not required to use those libraries if you submit new flash unit tests.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Running Tests</title>
		<para>The Red5 system tests require a special test server to be running. This is just a mostly empty red5 server with one special application installed:</para>
		<literallayout> 
http://localhost/selftest
</literallayout>
		<para>That selftest Red5 application has the following service exposed under the name "echo":</para>
		<literallayout> 
red5.server.services.IEchoService.java:
[http://code.google.com/p/red5/source/browse/java/server/trunk/test/org/red5/server/service/IEchoService.java]
</literallayout>
		<para>Every method on that Java Interface is callable from Flash by using the prefix "echo.".&amp;nbsp; For example, "echo.echoNumber" will call the echoNumber method over RTMP/AMF.&amp;nbsp;</para>
		<para>There are two ways to run the system test:</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis role="bold">Attended</emphasis> -  Run a Test Server 
		</para>
		<screen> 
$ ant run-tests-server
</screen>
		<para>Start up the Flash Self Test application</para>
		<literallayout> 
flashplayer tests/fixtures/red5-selftest.swf
</literallayout>
		<para> </para>
		<para>This method assumes someone is watching the test. </para>
		<para>
			<emphasis role="bold">Unattended</emphasis> - 
		</para>
		<screen> 
$ ant run-tests-systemtest
</screen>
		<para>This only works on Linux. 
			It starts up a red5 server, runs the system test in the background, and then collects all log artifacts in the directory "output" relative to the current directory. 
			It will also take snapshop pictures of the desktop as running if ImageMagick's import tool is installed. ||</para>
		<para>System tests run the server with RED5_HOME set to bin/testcases/testreports/dist, and runs the flash clients from the directory bin/testcases/testreports/fixtures.</para>
		<para>Lastly, you should ensure red5 is not currently running on the server you run a system test on. However, because the system tests use their own version of Red5, you don't need to worry about them clobbering anything in your own Red5 installation.</para>
		<para>The System Tests use a series of scripts located in:</para>
		<literallayout> 
test/scripts
</literallayout>
		<para>to automatically start-up and shutdown red5, as well as find the necessary flash logs from different parts of the system. The main one of interest is:</para>
		<literallayout> 
test/scripts/red5-flash-player-headless
</literallayout>
		<para>It assumes it's running under a Windowing system (e.g. XWindows) with a Bourne Shell, and then starts a clean red5 server, runs the Flash system tests, and cleans up afterwards.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Creating New Tests</title>
		<para>Writing unit tests in theAsUnit framework is beyond the scope of this document, but you can find help at the AsUnit site.</para>
		<para>But to create a new system test, you can start with the Flash selftest application:svn checkout 
			<link xl:href="http://red5.googlecode.com/svn/flash/trunk/selftest">http://red5.googlecode.com/svn/flash/trunk/selftest</link> red5_selftestTo create a new AsUnit test just create a newclass source file to the right path under test, and end the source filename with the string "Test.as". For example:
		</para>
		<literallayout> 
test/org/red5/server/decodingComplexObjectOverAMFTest3.as
</literallayout>
		<para>Once you do that, you'll need to modify the AllTests.as file in the directory to add your new test.</para>
		<para>We use 
			<link xl:href="http://ofb.net/~aclarke/theyard/flashutils-0.1.0/api/">The Yard flash libraries|http://code.google.com/p/theyard/</link> to abstract away some of the complexities of connecting to and manipulating NetConnection and NetStream objects. See the 
			<link xl:href="The">Yard flash library documentation</link>. You don't have to use them for new tests, but they can make things a lot easier (for example, by taking care of connecting for you).
		</para>
		<para>To see documentation of existing tests, run:</para>
		<literallayout> 
ant doc

	</section>
	<section>
		<title>A Sample System Test</title>
		<para>Here's a very straightforward System Test submitted by trebor (at) vlideshow.com.</para>
		<para>This test connects to the test server and calls the "echo.echoString" method to pass a String to Red5, and then make sure we get the same array back.&amp;nbsp; It tests both AMF0 and AMF3 using the same code path because they should be the same.</para>

		<title>Guidelines for New System Tests</title>
		<para>Unfortunately Flash ActionScript is not as forgiving as Java is about cleaning up after a test is finished, so the guidelines for writing System Tests are somewhat more involved.&amp;nbsp; Also, these tests MUST be runnable in a "unattended" mode \-\- meaning requiring no human interaction, to the bar is higher.</para>

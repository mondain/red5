	<title>Deploying Red5 To Tomcat</title>
	<section>
		<title>Preface</title>
		<para>This document describes how to deploy Red5 to Tomcat as web application 
			archive (WAR). The standard Red5 deployment consists of a standalone Java 
			application with an embedded J2EE container (Jetty or Tomcat) running as a 
			system service, whereas the WAR version runs inside of a J2EE container.</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Deployment</title>
		<para>The Tomcat war deployer scans the webapps directory for wars periodically. 
			When a war is found that has not yet been deployed, the deployer will expand 
			the war file into a directory based on the filename of the war. A war named 
			myapp.war would be expanded into a directory named myapp; depending upon 
			your installation the full path would look similar to this C:\Tomcat- 
			6.0.14\webapps\myapp. </para>
		<para>Red5 server is packaged into a file named ROOT.war, this filename has a 
			special connotation on most J2EE application servers and is normally the default 
			or root web context. The root web context is responsible for servicing requests 
			which do not contain a path component. A url with a path component looks like 

			<link xl:href="http://www.example.com/myapp">http://www.example.com/myapp</link> wheres root web application url would resemble 
			this 
			<link xl:href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</link>. An additional configuration file the context 
			descriptor, is located in the META-INF directory for each web context. 
			Applications that are not accessed via HTTP, do not require a web / servlet 
			context. The root war file contains nearly everything that is in a standalone server 
			build except for embedded server classes and select configuration files.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Context descriptors</title>
		<para>A Context XML descriptor is a fragment of XML data which contains a valid 
			Context element which would normally be found in the main Tomcat server 
			configuration file (conf/server.xml). For a given host, the Context descriptors are 
			located in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/. Note that while 
			the name of the file is not tied to the webapp name, when the deployer creates 
			descriptors from the context.xml files contained in the war; their names will match 
			the web application name. </para>
		<para>Context descriptors allow defining all aspects and configuration parameters of a 
			context, such as naming resources and session manager configuration. It should 
			be noted that the docBase specified in the Context element can refer to either the 
			.WAR or the directory which will be created when the .WAR is expanded or the 
			.WAR itself. </para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Red5 Configuration</title>
		<para>Configuration of the Red5 server consists of a few context parameters in the 
			web.xml, a default context file, a bean ref file, and a Spring web context file for 
			each application that will utilize Red5 features. Web applications that use only 
			AMF to communicate with Red5 do not require a configuration entry in the servers application context. The application context which is managed via Spring 
			is only available to applications that are contained within the root war; due to the 
			way that the web application classloaders work. In addition, Red5 uses a context 
			counterpart called a Scope which serves as a container for the context, handler, 
			server core instance, and a few other objects. A scope is similar to the 
			application model in FMS. 
			The initial entry point or startup servlet for Red5 is the WarLoaderServlet and it is 
			configured as a servlet listener in the web.xml as shown below. Functionally this 
			servlet  takes the place of the Standalone class in a standard Red5 server</para>

</programlisting>
		<para>This listener is responsible for starting and stopping Red5 upon receipt of context 
			initialized and context destroyed container events. The war loader is similar in 
			function to the Spring ContextLoaderListener servlet but is specialized for Red5.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Spring contexts</title>
			<para>There are two types of contexts used by Red5, "default" and "web"; there may be 
				only one default context but any number of web contexts. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Default context</title>
			<para>The default context is synonymous with the global application context and is 
				responsible for providing objects and resources at the top or global level. Spring 
				beans in this level are configured via the defaultContext.xml and 
				beanRefContext.xml which are located in the ROOT classes directory (ex. 
				C:\Tomcat-6.0.14\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\classes). The bean ref file defines 
				the default.context bean which as an instance of 
				org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext. Two 
				other configuration files red5-common.xml and red5-core.xml are used to 
				construct the default context; these files are derived from the standalone 
				configuration files of the same names, the primary difference is that the server 
				embedding sections have been removed. </para>
			<para>The default context is referenced in the web.xml via the parentContextKey 
				parameter: </para>

</programlisting>
			<para>This parameter is used by the ContextLoader to locate the parent context, which 
				in turn allows the global resources to be located. The context loader is used by 
				the WarLoaderServlet to initialize the web contexts. </para>
			<para>The scope counterpart to the global context is the global scope and it is 
				referenced in the web.xml via the globalScope parameter: </para>

			<title>Web context</title>
			<para>Web context definitions are specified in Spring configuration files suffixed with 
				-web.xml; If your application is named oflaDemo then its configuration file would 
				be named oflaDemo-web.xml. The Spring web context files should not be 
				confused with J2EE context descriptors as they are only used for red5 web 
				contexts and the later are used by Tomcat. Each web context must have a 
				corresponding configuration file, the configuration files are specified using an ant- 
				style parameter in the web.xml as shown below. </para>

			<para>Context configuration files specify the resources that are used to notify the 
				application about joining / leaving clients and provide the methods that 
				a client can call. Additionally, the configuration files specify the scope hierarchy 
				for these classes. </para>
			<para>Every context configuration must contain a minimum of three entries - a context, 
				scope, and handler. The only exception to this rule is the root web application 
				since it does not have a handler application, in this case the global handler is 
				used. </para>

				shown below. </para>

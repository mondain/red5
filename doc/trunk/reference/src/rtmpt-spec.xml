   <title>RTMPT Specification</title>
   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>This document describes the RTMPT tunneling protocol as implemented by the
         Red5 Open Source Flash Server. Please note that this document is _not_ an
         official specification by Macromedia but hopefully helps other people to
         write software that makes use of RTMPT.</para>
      <para>RTMPT basically is a HTTP wrapper around the RTMP protocol that is sent using
         POST requests from the client to the server. Because of the non-persistent
         nature of HTTP connections, RTMPT requires the clients to poll for updates
         periodically in order to get notified about events that are generated by the
         server or other clients.</para>
      <para>During the lifetime of a RTMPT session, four possible request types can be
         sent to the server which will be described below.</para>

   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-request-response">
      <title>Request / Response</title>
      <para>All HTTP requests share some common properties:</para>
      <blockquote>
         <itemizedlist mark="-">
            <listitem>
               <para>They use HTTP 1.1 POST.</para>

               <para>The content type is <citetitle>application/x-fcs</citetitle>.</para>

            <listitem>
               <para>The connection should be kept alive by the client and server to reduce
                  network overhead.</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
      </blockquote>
      <para>The HTTP responses also share some properties:</para>
      <blockquote>
         <itemizedlist mark="-">
            <listitem>
               <para>The content type is <citetitle>application/x-fcs</citetitle>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <para>For all established sessions the first byte of the response data controls
                  the polling interval of the client where higher values mean less polling
                  requests.</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
      </blockquote>
   </section>
   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-polling-interval">
      <title>Polling interval</title>
      <para>The server always starts with a value of 0x01 after data was returned and
         increases it after 10 emtpy replies. The maximum delay is 0x21 which causes
         a delay of approximately 0.5 seconds between two requests.</para>
      <para>Red5 currently increases the delay in the following steps:
         0x01, 0x03, 0x05, 0x09, 0x11, 0x21.</para>
   </section>
   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-initial-connect-command-open">
      <title>Initial connect (command "open")</title>
      <para>This is the first request that is sent to the server in order to register a
         client on the server and start a new session. The server replies with a unique
         id (usually a number) that is used by the client for all future requests.</para>
      <para>Note: the reply doesn't contain a value for the polling interval!
         A successful connect resets the consecutive index that is used in the URLs.</para>
   </section>
   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-client-updates-command-send">
      <title>Client updates (command "send")</title>
      <para>The data a client would send to the server using RTMP is simply prefixed with
         a HTTP header and otherwise sent unmodified.</para>
      <para>The server responds with a HTTP response containing one byte controlling the
         polling interval and the RTMP data if available.</para>
   </section>
   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-polling-requests-command-idle">
      <title>Polling requests (command "idle")</title>
      <para>If the client doesn't have more data to send to the server, he has to poll
         for updates to receive streaming data or events like shared objects.</para>
   </section>
   <section xml:id="rtmpt-spec-disconnect-of-a-session-command-close">
      <title>Disconnect of a session (command "close")</title>
      <para>If a client wants to terminate his connection, he sends the "close" command
         which is replied with a 0x00 by the server.</para>

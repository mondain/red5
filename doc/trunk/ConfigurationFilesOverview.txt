Preface
==========================
This document describes the configuration files used by Red5.

Please note that this document is still *work in progress*, so some things
may (and surely will) change until the final release of Red5 0.4!


Directory "conf"
==========================

jetty.xml
--------------------------
The settings of the HTTP server and servlet container are specified using
this file.  It runs on all available interfaces on port 5080 by default.

See the `Jetty homepage`__ for further informations about the syntax of this
file.

__ http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty6/


keystore
--------------------------
Contains a sample private key and certificate to be used for secure
connections.


log4j.properties
--------------------------
Controls the log levels and output handlers for the logging subsystem.

Further informations about log4j can be found on `the official homepage`__.

__ http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/


realm.properties
--------------------------
This file defines users passwords and roles that can be used for protected
areas.

The format is::

  <username>: <password>[,<rolename> ...]

Passwords may be clear text, obfuscated or checksummed.  The class 
"org.mortbay.util.Password" should be used to generate obfuscated passwords
or password checksums


red5.globals
--------------------------
Specifies the path to the configuration file for the default global context
to be used for Red5.

By default this file is located in "/webapps/red5-default.xml".


red5.properties
--------------------------
File containing key / value pairs to configure the host and port of basic
services like RTMP or remoting.


red5.xml
--------------------------
The main configuration file that wires together the context tree.  It takes
care of loading "red5-common.xml" and "red5-core.xml" and sets up the rest of
the server.  This is the first file to be loaded by Red5.


red5-common.xml
--------------------------
Classes that are shared between all child contexts are declared in this file.
It contains informations about the object serializers / deserializers, the
codecs to be used for the network protocols as well as the available video
codecs.


red5-core.xml
--------------------------
All available network services are specified here.  By default these are
RTMP and RTMPT.  The actual settings for the RTMPT server can be found in
"red5-rtmpt.xml".


red5-rtmpt.xml
--------------------------
Sets up the mapping between the RTMPT URLs and the servlets to use as well
as specify the host and port to run on.  By default the RTMPT server runs on
all available interfaces on port 8088.

See the `Jetty homepage`__ for further informations about the syntax of this
file.

web-default.xml
--------------------------
Default web.xml file.  The settings from this file are applied to a web
application before it's own WEB_INF/web.xml file.

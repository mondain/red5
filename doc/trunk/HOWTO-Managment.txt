I. JMX classes
Red5's implemenation consists of the following classes and various other MBeans:

org.red5.server.jmx.JMXFactory - Provides access to the platform MBeanServer as well as registration, unregistration, and creation of new MBean instances. Creation and registration is performed using StandardMBean wrappers.

org.red5.server.jmx.JMXAgent - Provides the HTML adapter and registration of MBeans.

org.red5.server.jmx.JMXUtil - Helper methods for working with ObjectName or MBean instances.


II. Spring configuration
The spring configuration for the JMX implementation allows you to configure the "domain" for MBean registration and listener port for the HTML adaptor. The default entries are shown below.

	<!-- JMX server -->
	<bean id="jmxFactory" class="org.red5.server.jmx.JMXFactory">
		<property name="domain" value="org.red5.server"/>
	</bean>
	<bean id="jmxAgent" class="org.red5.server.jmx.JMXAgent" init-method="init">
		<property name="htmlAdapterPort" value="8082"/>
	</bean>

The HTML adaptor is enabled by default and allows managment of MBeans from a web browser.


III. jConsole

JConsole is a utility that ships with the JRE (since 1.5), it allows you to manage local and remote JMX implementations. To enable introspection you must add the following VM parameter to your startup:

	-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote

After the parameter is set and the application initialized you can start jconsole at the command line by typing:

	jconsole

A swing application will appear and you must select implemenation (agent) you wish to manage, for local simply select "org.red5.server.Standalone".

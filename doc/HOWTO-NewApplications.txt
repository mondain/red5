HOWTO create new applications in Red5
=====================================

:author: Joachim Bauch (jojo@struktur.de)

This document describes how new applications can be created in Red5.

1. Create a new folder under the "apps" directory with the name of your
   new application.

2. Create a file "app.xml" inside the new directory with the following
   contents::
   
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN"
               "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd">
     <beans>
       <bean id="appService"
             class="org.red5.example.HowtoApplication"
             singleton="true"
             />
     </beans>

   The "class" attribute defines the Java class that will be instantiated
   when the application is loaded.

3. The class specified in the "app.xml" must extend
   "org.red5.server.context.BaseApplication" and implement the interface
   "org.red5.server.context.AppLifecycleAware".
   
   You can override the following methods:
   
   public void onAppStart();
     Gets executed when the application starts.
     
   public void onAppStop();
     Gets executed when the application is terminated.
     
   public boolean onConnect(Client client, List params);
     Called for each client that connects to the application.  Return `true`
     if the client is allowed to connect, `false` otherwise.
     
   public void onDisconnect(Client client);
     Called for each client that leaves the application.

4. Restart Red5, you should see log entries that your application has been
   loaded.

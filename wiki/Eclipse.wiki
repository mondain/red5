This section contains Eclipse related entries or fixes.

== Error - A cycle was detected ==

When working in Eclipse you may see an "Error" such as this:

{{{
A cycle was detected in the build path of project 'red5_client'. The cycle consists of projects {red5_client, red5_server}	red5_client		
}}}

To remove this blocking item go to *Properties > Java Compiler > Building*. Under *Build path problems* change the "Circular dependencies" option to "Warning"; then click "OK"

== Eclipse plugins ==

This is a screen capture of my installed plugins; I know some of you have had issues with m2e or eclipse + maven, so here are the ones I have loaded that work.

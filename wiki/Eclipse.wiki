== Error - A cycle was detected ==

When working in Eclipse you may see an "Error" such as this:

{{{
A cycle was detected in the build path of project 'red5_client'. The cycle consists of projects {red5_client, red5_server}	red5_client		
}}}

To remove this blocking item go to *Properties > Java Compiler > Building*. Under *Build path problems* change the "Circular dependencies" option to "Warning"; then click "OK"

== M2e goal is not supported ==

With some older versions of the codebase you may see this error in Eclipse: 
{{{
maven-dependency-plugin (goals �copy-dependencies�, �unpack�) is not supported by m2e
}}}
The fix has been on trunk for some time now, but some users still see it. You can find more detail here:

org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No unique bean of type [org.red5.server.net.rtmp.RTMPConnManager] is defined: expected single bean but found 2: rtmpMinaConnManager,rtmptConnManager

 # Remove this node
{{{
<bean id="rtmptConnManager" class="org.red5.server.net.rtmp.RTMPConnManager" />
}}}
 # Locate the rtmptServlet bean and change this node from
{{{
<property name="rtmpConnManager" ref="rtmptConnManager" />
}}}
 to 
{{{
<property name="rtmpConnManager" ref="rtmpMinaConnManager" />
}}}
Save and close the file, then restart red5

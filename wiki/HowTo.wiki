== Turning on the LogFilter in Mina ==

The logging filter gives more insight into what I/O operations are occurring within the Mina layer.

1. Add this node to the rtmpTransport bean entry in the conf/red5-core.xml file
{{{
    <property name="enableMinaLogFilter" value="${mina.logfilter.enable}" />
}}}
2. Add this to your conf/red5.properties file
{{{
    mina.logfilter.enable=true
}}}
3. Add this to your conf/logback.xml
{{{
    <logger name="org.red5.server.net.rtmp.RTMPMinaTransport">
        <level value="INFO"/>
    </logger>
}}}
You'll see entries from the logger like this:
{{{
2013-04-24 09:40:35,285 [NioProcessor-2] INFO  o.r.s.net.rtmp.RTMPMinaTransport - CREATED
}}}
